# primes-hs

Prime number routines and a test suite in Haskell. Based off an exercise in the
book "Get Programming With Haskell". This library uses QuickCheck for testing
and implements "naive" prime number tests as well as the Miller-Rabin
probablistic prime number test.

## Building

This project uses stack, so building it is as easy as `stack build`. You can
run tests with `stack test`.
